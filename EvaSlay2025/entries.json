The rest of the night was nothing short of spectacular: the first bedrose live performance, nate from albertsons arriving, getting a chance to speak on behalf of the house eulogy style, and even getting the cops called. All of that was so amazing and great, but my fondest memory from this night is the hug/moment we got to share in the living room together. You were there for me in an important moment, and I’ll never forget that. Thanks for always being there for me, and thanks for sharing so so many great memories with me over the years in this house.

At the end of 2024, I noticed I had a really special group of friends around me who are all musicians and music lovers to some degree. The urge to keep Tuesday comradery alive inspired a weekly zoom call that started back in January, and we kept it alive all the way through 2025. Having Tarkan move back in with the boys over the summer was a canon event, and we no longer needed the zoom call to have these music share-sessions together. It's crazy to look at Tarkan playing video games on my couch in this photo and think back to where we all were at the beginning of the year.\n\nTonight was the beginning of a series of endings to celebrate all the love we shared in 2025.",

Today was a day of letting go of the Douglases. While our name change is not necessarily official yet, we filmed our announcement video today, and I endured a solid amount of emotions after the fact. The change this band is going through feels like it's happening so fast, but I'm doing my best to trust the process.\n\nYou and I ended up on a special phone call together today when we needed to configure our Domino's order (cheesy bread was definitely the move). The circumstances that led to the phone call came from individual crash outs we were having, and it felt as though the universe put us together right when it mattered most. I felt the love today, and I'm so glad you came over with Dominos in the evening. We both had long days (and a long week), so getting to spend quality time together just relaxing and chowing down on some cheesy bread and Domino's sprite was such a good move. I'm so so in love with you Eva <3\n\nAlso Cody got his Amazon job back today! Phew!",

This project was a lot of work to put together, but this labor of love was SO so worth it (and truly it was so much fun).\n\nI hope this scrapbook serves to remind you/us of how special this year was. 2025 was a wild ride to say the least. It was the year of the snake. It was the year of the Douglases! Temple relocated!! You got your first salary job!!! We went to Lost Lands!!!! The Epstein Files were released!!!!! Yeah this year was fucking crazy!!\n\nBut most of all: this year was special because of you <3 Thanks for a great 2025! I can't wait to keep living life with you! And happy early Valentine's Day (since that's when I plan on gifting this to you)!!\n\nHere's us a few days before our first kiss :)",
